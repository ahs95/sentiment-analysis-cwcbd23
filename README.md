## Sentiment and Sarcasm Detection in Bangla: Reactions to Bangladesh’s 2023 World Cup

This repository contains the implementation, dataset, and models for the paper **"Bangla Sentiment and Sarcasm Detection: Reactions to Bangladesh’s 2023 World Cup."** The study focuses on detecting sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and sarcasm in Bangla social media comments related to cricket, particularly reactions to Bangladesh's 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup campaign.

The project addresses **class imbalance**, employs **language-specific pretraining**, and introduces a **dual-head transformer-based model** fine-tuned using **BanglaBERT** with **focal loss**. Additionally, we provide an interactive **Gradio demo** for real-time inference.

### 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Manually Annotated Dataset**: A comprehensive collection of **5,635 Bangla comments**.
- ✅ **Custom Dual-Head Classification Model**: Designed for joint sentiment and sarcasm detection.
- ✅ **Focal Loss Integration**: Effectively handles class imbalance in the dataset.
- ✅ **Multilabel Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Ensures robust model evaluation.
- ✅ **Interactive Gradio Interface**: Facilitates real-time predictions and user interaction.
- ✅ **Open Source**: Publicly available code and dataset for reproducibility and further research.
